      "Mastering the basics in AI can help you jump-start your career and get ready to dive deeper into the other technical opportunities Azure offers. Artificial intelligence (AI) opens doors into possibilities that might have seemed like science fiction only yesterday. Using AI, you can build solutions, improve your apps, and advance technology in many fields, including healthcare, financial management, and environmental protection, to name just a few. The Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Fundamentals certification could be a great fit for you if you'd like to: Prove that you have the AI skills it takes to build a better world. Earning your Azure AI Fundamentals certification can supply the foundation you need to build your career and demonstrate your knowledge of common AI and machine learning workloads—and what Azure services can solve for them. Validate your foundational knowledge of machine learning and AI concepts, along with related Azure services., It is recommended to have some general programming knowledge or experience, but it is not required. You can use Azure AI fundamentals to reinforce your basics for other Azure role-based certifications, like Azure Data Scientist Associate, Azure AI Engineer Associate, or Azure Developer Associate, but its not a prerequisite for any of them. NOTE: Passing score: 700",

    "This exam is an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) concepts and related Microsoft Azure services. Candidates for this exam should have familiarity with AI-900’s self-paced or instructor-led learning material. This exam is intended for candidates with both technical and non-technical backgrounds. Data science and software engineering experience are not required; however, awareness of cloud basics and client-server applications would be beneficial. Azure AI Fundamentals can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based certifications like Azure Data Scientist Associate or Azure AI Engineer Associate, but it is not a prerequisite for any of them.",
