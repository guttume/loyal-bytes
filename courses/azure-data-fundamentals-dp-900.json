    "description": "To master data in the cloud, you need the right foundation—a solid understanding of core data concepts, such as relational data, nonrelational data, big data, and analytics. Plus, familiarity with the roles, tasks, and responsibilities in the world of data and data analytics. Are you there? Certification can help you prove it. The certification offers the foundation you need to build your technical skills to start working with data in the cloud. Mastering the basics can help you jump-start your career and prepare you to dive deeper into other technical opportunities Azure offers. If you’re beginning to work with data in the cloud, this certification is for you. It is recommended to have familiarity with the concepts of relational and nonrelational data and with different types of data workloads, such as transactional or analytical."
